# Should I pipe it?

__Is this installation script safe to pipe into my shell?__

Piping a script to your shell is a common way (especially for developers) to install apps from the Web. However, it is also notoriously risky, especially if you don’t know what exactly you’re asking your computer to execute.

Should I pipe it? is a simple attempt to solve the latter problem.

## Usage

<pre><code><strong>https://should-i-pipe.it/</strong>https://link.to/some/script</pre></code>

## Example

```
https://should-i-pipe.it/https://sitejs.org/install
```
